In order to estimate a value (regression) or class membership (classification), the algorithm finds the observations in its training data that are \"nearest\" to the observation to predict. It then averages or takes a vote of those training observations' target values to estimate the value for the new data point.\n",

These methods are **nonparametric** When we make no assumptions about the distribution for our data, we call our data nonparametric.
